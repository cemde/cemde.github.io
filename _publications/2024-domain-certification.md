## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed to do constrained tasks, with narrow domains. For example, customer support bots can be built on top of LLMs, relying on their broad language understanding and capabilities to enhance performance. However, these LLMs are adversarially susceptible, potentially generating outputs outside the intended domain. To formalize, assess and mitigate this risk, we introduce \emph{domain certification}; a guarantee that accurately characterizes the out-of-domain behavior of language models. We then propose a simple yet effective approach dubbed VALID that provides adversarial bounds as a certificate. Finally, we evaluate our method across a diverse set of datasets, demonstrating that it yields meaningful certificates.
