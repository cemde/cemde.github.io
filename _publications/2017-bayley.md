## Abstract

The “difference or delay paradigm” focuses on the question of whether children with
developmental disabilities (DD) develop in a way that is only delayed, compared to typically
developing children, or also qualitatively different. The current study aimed to examine
whether qualitative differences exist in cognitive development of young children with and
without DD on the basis of item scores on the Dutch Bayley-III Cognition scale. Differential
Item Functioning was identified for 15 of the 91 items. The presence of DD was related to a
higher number of Guttman errors, hinting at more deviation in the order of skill development.
An interaction between group (i.e., with or without DD) and developmental quotient appeared
to predict the number of Guttman errors. DD was related to a higher number of Guttman
errors for the whole range of developmental quotients; children with DD with a small
developmental quotient had the highest number. Combined, the results mean that qualitative
differences in development are not to be excluded, especially in cases of severe
developmental disabilities. When using the Bayley-III in daily practice, the possibility needs
to be taken into account that the instruments’ assumption of a fixed order in skill development
does not hold.
