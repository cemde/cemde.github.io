excerpt: "We investigate predictive coding networks by developing a more efficient and stable training algorithm through a simple temporal scheduling change to synaptic weight updates. This incremental predictive coding approach not only provides theoretical convergence guarantees and improved biological plausibility, but consistently outperforms original formulations across image classification and language modeling tasks."

## Abstract

Predictive coding networks are neuroscience-inspired models with roots in both Bayesian statistics and neuroscience. Training such models, however, is quite inefficient and unstable. In this work, we show how by simply changing the temporal scheduling of the update rule for the synaptic weights leads to an algorithm that is much more efficient and stable than the original one, and has theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence. The proposed algorithm, that we call incremental predictive coding (iPC) is also more biologically plausible than the original one, as it it fully automatic. In an extensive set of experiments, we show that iPC constantly performs better than the original formulation on a large number of benchmarks for image classification, as well as for the training of both conditional and masked language models, in terms of test accuracy, efficiency, and convergence with respect to a large set of hyperparameters.
