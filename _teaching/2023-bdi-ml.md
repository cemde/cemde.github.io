### Practicals

I tutored a seminar on applied machine learning for doctoral students in Health Data Science. Main responibility was to assist students solving practical classes on machine learning problems. This included classical machine machine learning learning and deep learning - supervised and unsupervised learning. Further, I co-supervised a data challenge for representation learning based on genetic (SNP) sequencing data.
