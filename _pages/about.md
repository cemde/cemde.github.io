I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the Univeristy of Oxford. Last year, I interned at Wise in London as a Machine Learning Research Scientist.

My PhD research focuses on:

- Medical Machine learning: In particular applications in personalised medicine
- Robustness: Ensuring ML methods predict with certain garuantees and do not fail unpredictedly in safety relevant applications.
- Uncertainty: Getting meaningful uncertainty information from Neural Networks
- Calibration: Matching predictive distributions with probabilities for interpretable and robust machine learning.
- Probabistic Deep Learning: Bayesian Deep Learning, Generative Models

My supervisors are:

- [Prof Thomas Lukasiewicz](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/thomas.lukasiewicz/), Intelligent Systems Lab, Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford
- [Adel Bibi](https://www.adelbibi.com/), Torr Vision Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford
- [Prof Michael Wooldridge](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/), Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford
