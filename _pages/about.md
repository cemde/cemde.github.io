I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the Univeristy of Oxford interested in AI Safety. I am currently looking for internship and full-time research positions.

My PhD research focuses on:

- Robustness: Ensuring ML methods predict with certain garuantees and do not fail unpredictedly in safety relevant applications.
- Uncertainty: Getting meaningful uncertainty measurements from neural networks.
- Calibration: Matching predictive distributions with probabilities for interpretable and robust machine learning.
- Probabistic Deep Learning: Bayesian Deep Learning, Generative Models
- Medical Machine learning: Applications of machine learning in personalised medicine. Interpretability of multimodal models in clinical practice.

My supervisors are:

- [Prof Thomas Lukasiewicz](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/thomas.lukasiewicz/), Intelligent Systems Lab, Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford & Informatics, Technical University of Vienna
- [Adel Bibi](https://www.adelbibi.com/), Torr Vision Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford
- [Prof Michael Wooldridge](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/), Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford
- [Prof Philip Torr](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/philip-torr/), Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford

News:

- [February 2025] I am fortunate to have 3 papers accepted into ICLR 2025 including 1 spotlight.
- [November 2024] I have contributed to an amazing effort lead by Maxime Kayser that won an EMNLP 2024 outstanding paper award.
